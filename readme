Distributed raytracer written in C#.

- LucidServer is the master app.
- LucidClient is the worker. Run it on multiple machines and connect to the LucidServer.
  The client downloads the definition of the scene and starts rendering parts of the image.
  You can also start and connect new clients during rendering.
  Crashed clients are not a problem - their job will be assigned to someone else.
- LucidLib is a generic library for defining distributed computations. 
- Raytracing is a generic raytracing implementation (see Scene.cs). 
- Editor is a very simple program (no UI) used to generate test scenes (see scenes.cs).
  (It needs scene files to be present in its bin folder)

Tests on 7 machines show almost linear speedup as expected.
